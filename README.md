# Console Task Manager (Python)

##  Description
A simple console-based Task Manager written in Python.
The project was created as a learning exercise to practice object-oriented programming (OOP), basic application architecture
and data persistence using JSON.

## Features
- Add new tasks
- Remove tasks
- Mark tasks as completed or active
- View all tasks
- Filter completed and active tasks
- Save tasks to a JSON file
- Automatically load tasks on program start

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Lists and loops
- JSON file handling
- Console input/output

## Data Storage
Tasks are stored locally in a JSON file ('tasks.json'). All changes are automatically saved, and tasks are restored on program start.

##  Project Structure
task_manager
- task.py
- task_manager.py
- main.py
- tasks.json
- README.md

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Eleonorichka/console-task-manager.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
cd console-task-manager
3. Run the application:
python main.py

## Purpose of the Project
The main goal of this project was to strengthen my Python fundamentals,
understand how to structure a small application, practice OOP principles in a real example, learn how to separate logic into multiple files and prepare projects
for a GitHub portfolio.
